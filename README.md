As I'm working through Brian Holt's [Intermediate React course]( https://bit.ly/react-v4), I am overhauling the styles and making changes as I go.

This is essentially a fork of the [original course repo](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v4) master branch. The initial code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Things I've done:

Added the new [SVGR Parcel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/parcel-plugin-svgr) to import svg as components.

Designed a logo and restyled everything.

Improved markup accessibility.

Added more tests and an SVG mock.
